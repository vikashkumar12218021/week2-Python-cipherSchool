# tuple is data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update in tuple data
example = ('one','two','three')
# no append , no insert,no pop ,no remove
# days = ("monday ","sunday","tuesday")
# tuples are faster than lists
example[0] = 1
